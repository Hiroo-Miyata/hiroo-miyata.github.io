I have been a PhD student at Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University since 2022.08. I am advised by Dr. Steve Chase and working on neural population analysis for understanding motor control. I received my B.E from The University of Tokyo , Japan, under the supervison of Dr. Takao Someya and Dr. Tomoyuki Yokota where I developed Brain-Machine-Interface(BMI) which subjects can press button in VR just by thinking

I have a dream to develop brain-computer-interface which empower human's cognitive ability.
